## Candy-Popularity-EDA
# Purpose
The purpose for this project is to analyze popularity amongst different types of candies. The question of "what is the most popular candy on Halloween?" has been on my mind since I first started trick or treating myself. Outside of satsifying my curiousity, this case study can help companies determine what type of candies to sell and market during Halloween to improve their sales.
# Data
The data set for this study is from David Ng's 2017 survey: https://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/
# Status of the project
The project is still on going. Currently I am still in the middle of cleaning the data.
